        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I am studying at ITMO University with a degree in Mobile and Network Technologies and want to become a
            front-end
            developer. I would like to learn a relevant and interesting profession, so in my free time from studying, I
            decided
            to take courses from rsschool. My goal is to become a good specialist and within six months to gain the work
            skills
            necessary for employment. At the moment, I participated in team educational projects, where I tried myself as a
            developer: a photo conversion site and a university job search site “ITMO-HUNTER”. I am extremely inspired by
            the
            result, but I still lack skills in website layout and design</p>
